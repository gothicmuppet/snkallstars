Welcome. I am making a review of my experience playing SNK All stars.

## Gameplay

- It uses energy meter to determine the strength of the attack.
- Energy meter is a max of 12 units.
- The attack cards range from 1 to 4.
- Gameplay is interactive because you can create combos for the 4 types of attacks.

## My review

**Strengths**
1. This game plays similiar to KOFumol.
2. Artwork is nice
3. Characters come from Last Blade and Samurai Showdown

**Weaknesses**
1. In the gameplay, if you take too long to decide on a plan, then you skip your turn.
2. In gameplay, the computer will always do an attack and super.
3. Adding guest characters from other games instead of focusing more on the KOF universe.
