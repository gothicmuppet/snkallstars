Welcome. I am making a review of my experience playing SNK All stars.

## Gameplay

- It uses energy meter to determine the strength of the attack.
- Energy meter is a max of 12 units.
- The attack cards range from 1 to 4.
- Gameplay is interactive because you can create combos for the 4 types of attacks.

## My review

**Strengths**
1. This game plays similiar to KOFumol. It has raid mode and stars to level characters up.
2. Artwork is nice
3. Characters come from Last Blade and Samurai Showdown
4. Boosting all characters is needed. If you play other modes, the bonus on those characters get passed to the other modes where recruiting fighters are random in a small RPG side quest.
5. Sometimes the quest has different goals to keep the game interesting.
6. Character frags are cheaper than KOFumol according to number.

**Weaknesses**
1. In the gameplay, if you take too long to decide on a plan, then you skip your turn.
2. In gameplay, the computer will always do an attack and super.
3. Adding guest characters from other games instead of focusing more on the KOF universe.
4. The store to gain characters is very small compared to KOFumol
5. Sometimes the suggestion of taking on the quest is not accurate. For example, my teams power is 27,000 and the suggested team power to pass the quest is 25,000 and I still cannot pass it. Very frustrating.
6. Upgrading characters using stars requires star enegery. Star energy can only be gained by converting character fragments.
